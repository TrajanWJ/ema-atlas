# Cron jobs (Gateway scheduler)

> **Cron vs Heartbeat?** See [Cron vs Heartbeat](/automation/cron-vs-heartbeat) for guidance on when to use each.

Cron is the Gateway’s built-in scheduler. It persists jobs, wakes the agent at
the right time, and can optionally deliver output back to a chat.

If you want _“run this every morning”_ or _“poke the agent in 20 minutes”_,
cron is the mechanism.

Troubleshooting: [/automation/troubleshooting](/automation/troubleshooting)

## TL;DR

- Cron runs **inside the Gateway** (not inside the model).
- Jobs persist under `~/.openclaw/cron/` so restarts don’t lose schedules.
- Two execution styles:
  - **Main session**: enqueue a system event, then run on the next heartbeat.
  - **Isolated**: run a dedicated agent turn in `cron:<jobId>`, with delivery (announce by default or none).
- Wakeups are first-class: a job can request “wake now” vs “next heartbeat”.
- Webhook posting is per job via `delivery.mode = "webhook"` + `delivery.to = "<url>"`.
- Legacy fallback remains for stored jobs with `notify: true` when `cron.webhook` is set, migrate those jobs to webhook delivery mode.
- For upgrades, `openclaw doctor --fix` can normalize legacy cron store fields before the scheduler touches them.

## Quick start (actionable)

Create a one-shot reminder, verify it exists, and run it immediately:

```bash
openclaw cron add \
  --name "Reminder" \
  --at "2026-02-01T16:00:00Z" \
  --session main \
  --system-event "Reminder: check the cron docs draft" \
  --wake now \
  --delete-after-run

openclaw cron list
openclaw cron run <job-id>
openclaw cron runs --id <job-id>
```

Schedule a recurring isolated job with delivery:

```bash
openclaw cron add \
  --name "Morning brief" \
  --cron "0 7 * * *" \
  --tz "America/Los_Angeles" \
  --session isolated \
  --message "Summarize overnight updates." \
  --announce \
  --channel slack \
  --to "channel:C1234567890"
```

## Tool-call equivalents (Gateway cron tool)

For the canonical JSON shapes and examples, see [JSON schema for tool calls](/automation/cron-jobs#json-schema-for-tool-calls).

## Where cron jobs are stored

Cron jobs are persisted on the Gateway host at `~/.openclaw/cron/jobs.json` by default.
The Gateway loads the file into memory and writes it back on changes, so manual edits
are only safe when the Gateway is stopped. Prefer `openclaw cron add/edit` or the cron
tool call API for changes.

## Beginner-friendly overview

Think of a cron job as: **when** to run + **what** to do.

1. **Choose a schedule**
   - One-shot reminder → `schedule.kind = "at"` (CLI: `--at`)
   - Repeating job → `schedule.kind = "every"` or `schedule.kind = "cron"`
   - If your ISO timestamp omits a timezone, it is treated as **UTC**.

2. **Choose where it runs**
   - `sessionTarget: "main"` → run during the next heartbeat with main context.
   - `sessionTarget: "isolated"` → run a dedicated agent turn in `cron:<jobId>`.

3. **Choose the payload**
   - Main session → `payload.kind = "systemEvent"`
   - Isolated session → `payload.kind = "agentTurn"`

Optional: one-shot jobs (`schedule.kind = "at"`) delete after success by default. Set
`deleteAfterRun: false` to keep them (they will disable after success).

## Concepts

### Jobs

A cron job is a stored record with:

- a **schedule** (when it should run),
- a **payload** (what it should do),
- optional **delivery mode** (`announce`, `webhook`, or `none`).
- optional **agent binding** (`agentId`): run the job under a specific agent; if
  missing or unknown, the gateway falls back to the default agent.

Jobs are identified by a stable `jobId` (used by CLI/Gateway APIs).
In agent tool calls, `jobId` is canonical; legacy `id` is accepted for compatibility.
One-shot jobs auto-delete after success by default; set `deleteAfterRun: false` to keep them.

### Schedules

Cron supports three schedule kinds:

- `at`: one-shot timestamp via `schedule.at` (ISO 8601).
- `every`: fixed interval (ms).
- `cron`: 5-field cron expression (or 6-field with seconds) with optional IANA timezone.

Cron expressions use `croner`. If a timezone is omitted, the Gateway host’s
local timezone is used.

To reduce top-of-hour load spikes across many gateways, OpenClaw applies a
deterministic per-job stagger window of up to 5 minutes for recurring
top-of-hour expressions (for example `0 * * * *`, `0 */2 * * *`). Fixed-hour
expressions such as `0 7 * * *` remain exact.

For any cron schedule, you can set an explicit stagger window with `schedule.staggerMs`
